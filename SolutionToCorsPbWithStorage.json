/* When importing data from the storage, i had a lot of problems with CORS
 I had difficulty to figure it out and not a lot of ressources
 I found the solution in the google cloud documentation instead of the firebase documentation

 1/ Download GSutil https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install?hl=fr by following instructions
 2/ make a cors.json like the one below
 3/ https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/cors#synopsis
 4/ make the origin ["*"] while working on it
 5/ The following command "gsutil cors set cors.json gs://mybucket"

*/
[
	{
	  "origin": ["*"],
	  "method": ["GET"],
	  "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
	}
]
